              <p>I'm a 21 year old software developer in the making and I have always enjoyed computers and have built a couple for myself and my friends. Although I may be a big nerd, I am <span style="color: yellow;">VERY</span> social and love being around people! A couple of hobbies I enjoy that allow for me to do that are snowboarding and music. I started snowboarding 9 years ago at MT.Hood meadows and bought a car specifically for getting me to the mountain safely. Music on the other hand I have been a part of for as long as I can remember, I started on the piano when I was in grade school, which turned into guitar later on down the road! I joined a band at the end of 8th grade and I began to sing for them. My mom was a country/rock singer that was signed to a record label and opened for people like Kelly Pickler, so I guess they figured if I came from that I should have a little bit of raw talent.</p>

My step-mom had mentioned to me about this program and after alittle digging I found that it might be somthing I would really be intrested in. so here I am.....</p>
